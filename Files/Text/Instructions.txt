You will be playing as Pac-Man. 

1. The goal of the game is to collect 
all the food on the tiles without 
getting eaten by the monsters chasing 
you.
2. Use arrow keys to navigate Pac-Man 
throughout the maze. 
3. Collect the larger pieces of food 
to briefly render monsters defenseless.
4. You will have 3 tries before losing. 
5. You get an extra life every 10,000 
points.

Good luck!
